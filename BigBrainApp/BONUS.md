1. We added a feedback alert for users registering or logging in when they have the correct or incorrect detailed. Another feedback was done in the form of a snackbar when an user clicks on 'Copy Link' after starting a new game and it lets the user know that in 3 seconds, they will be going to the advance page to control the game.
2. We added protection to our routes, where users without a valid token is taken back to the home page but they are still allowed to play a game if given a valid active game. They are just not allowed to visit any of the admin pages. This is because we were noticing a player can go on an admin's dashboard and other pages after playing a game.
3. We advocated the use of icons throughout the website as well as icons that accompany any words to help the user be more familiar with certain functions like a trash can next to delete or a play button that means start.
4. In our play game page, we print the user's selections so that they know what they have once chosen and enable them to reset their options in the case of multiple choice.
5. We have a live lobby, whereby a user can see other users who are also waiting in the lobby.
