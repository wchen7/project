Accessibility
- Use of captions on each table enables most screen readers to summarise what the intent of the table is and helps users to find a table and understand what it is about or if they want to read further into it.
- Use of alt text in images and videos allows the user to understand what the rendered item will be
- The relationship between a component and it's text size is always proportional to what the component's importance in - eg a smaller button has a smaller role to play compared to a larger button with bigger text
- The colour of components will never overpower the colour of the text, and contrast colours are always to differentiate text with component, eg a success button has a green overlay with white text. Also, the green overlay is to appeal to the use's general sense of colour where green means good and red means bad
